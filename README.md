# Spread of COVID-19 in The Netherlands
In this repository, the spread of _confirmed_ COVID-19 cases will be explored.
I am aware that the data is not complete. Due to a shortage of testkits, many COVID-19 patients cannot get tested and the number of confirmed cases is a severe underestimation of reality. However, it is the best data available.

## Sources
All data on confirmed COVID-19 cases was taken from the Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu ([RIVM](rivm.nl))
