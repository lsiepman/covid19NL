# SIR Model Graphs Explanation
The SIR model is a compartmental model in epidemiology. More information can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology)

In this repository, an interactive graph is made to visualise the process of *flattening the Curve*. It is not based on actual numbers of infections.

The code included in this folder is necessary to run the flask app. This can be done by executing the *sir_model_flask.py* with python.

Example images can be found in the *Examples* folder of this repository.
